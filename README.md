# hello world

This is a test Repo for my Git practice
I am planning to journal my progress of learning Git here. 

3/26/2025
    I learned:
        git init
        git status
        git add ___
        git add --all 
    It is also recommended to add README file in Repo
    Each Commit should have a message to describe each change

    I am writing this line on GitHub
    And Im writing this from VScode on my Mac to see how pushing to Github works
